      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <p>How I became a technical writer.</p>
      <h2>United States</h2>
      <p>I grew up in the United States, and I graduated from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. 
        I loved researching, editing, interviewing, and writing. 
        One of my campus jobs was to be an English tutor for foreign exchange students. 
        I regularly reviewed texts written by non-native English speakers.
</p>
      <h2>Ecuador</h2>
      <p>After I graduated college, I moved to Ecuador after college to work as a language arts teacher at the Center for Inter-American Studies in Cuenca. 
        I taught English writing and composition courses to Ecuadorian high school students. 
        I taught my students how to write for a target audience, and how to make their writing more concise. 
        I also initiated publishing projects at the Amaru Wildlife Park. 
        I built relationships with a local newspaper, wrote six chapters (___ words) of a book documenting the park’s conservation efforts, and edited technical documents, including a veterinary care manual.

      <h2>United States</h2>
      <p>
        In March 2020, I was awarded a Fulbright grant, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the start of my grant. 
        I moved back to Seattle to work as a contact tracer for the COVID response effort. 
        I was given an interview script in English and Spanish and conducted 10 interviews per day, and documented quantitative and qualitative data for epidemiologists. 
        I realized that rephrasing small prompts and phrases changed responses. 
        I would alter phrasing to preserve epidemiologist's intended meaning and convey complex concepts as quickly and succinctly as possible. 
      </p>

      <h2>Colombia</h2>
      <p>The US State Department allowed Fulbright grantees to return to Colombia in 2021. 
        I was placed at the University of Antonio Nariño in Bogotá, where I created courses on medical English, US arts and literature, and English grammar. 
        One of my main responsibilities was to edit academic research conducted by university professors.
</p>
      <p>I was promoted to Senior Fulbright Grantee.
      I was a staff mentor for five first-time grantees.
      I moved to the Universidad Tecnológica y Pedagogica de Colombia.
      I was given a small budget to manage for teacher-training projects.
      </p>

      <h2>United States</h2>
      <p>After my experiences in Colombia, I knew I wanted to become a technical writer. 
        I didn’t have a tech background, so I did some self-study of GitHub and HTML. 
        I also wrote manuals, training videos, and video scripts for community fitness, a local business in Seattle. 
        I applied and was accepted into the UW technical writing course, where I learned…</p>
