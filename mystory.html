      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <p>How I became a technical writer.</p>
      <h2>United States</h2>
      <p>I grew up in the United States, and I graduated from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. 
        I loved researching, editing, interviewing, and writing. 
        One of my campus jobs was to be an English tutor for foreign exchange students. 
        I regularly reviewed texts written by non-native English speakers.
